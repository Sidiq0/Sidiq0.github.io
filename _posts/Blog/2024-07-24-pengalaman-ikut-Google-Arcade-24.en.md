Hi üëã, it seems like it's been over a month since I've updated this blog, hehe üòÖ . Well, that's because I've been busy participating in the [Google Arcade Fasilitator 24 ](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/arcade-fasilitator-id)

This program is a coding scholarship from Google with a gamification concept, like playing a game. We earn points for each course we complete, and those points can be exchanged for Google merchandise. The program ran from May 15, 2024, to July 15, 2024, and I didn't join until June 15, 2024, so I was a bit short on time hehe üòÖ .

Here is the Arcade point calculation scheme:

And here is the list of prizes:

Since I was aiming for the premium prize, I had to collect at least 60 points. This means I needed to complete over 80 courses. Automatically, I had to think creatively to complete the courses quickly in a limited time ‚è±Ô∏è.

From there, I researched and found out about Shell Scripting. With Shell Scripting, I could combine the commands needed to complete the courses all at once, without having to manually copy and paste them into Google Cloud Shell ‚å®Ô∏è. Alhamdulillah, I managed to complete the courses in a total of 240 hours (from an estimated 389 hours), making it 30% faster ‚ö°Ô∏è!

On July 22, 2024, I received a "love letter" from Google, yeay! All that's left is to wait for the long-awaited merchandise to arrive at home ü•∞.
