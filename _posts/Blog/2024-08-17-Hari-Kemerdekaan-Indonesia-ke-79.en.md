Finally, thank God, we have arrived at Indonesia's 79th Independence Day! (❁´◡`❁)

<!--more-->

Speaking of 17th of August celebrations, it's usually synonymous with cracker eating contests, putting pencils into bottles contests, and so on. When I was little, I always looked forward to this day because I could participate in various competitions, haha.

Then, during junior high school, I liked Independence Day because there were often special events in online games. Back then, I used to play Point Blank.

Now, my reason for waiting for Independence Day has changed. Now, I want to enjoy the holiday and look for special Independence Day promos, hehe.

Btw, do you guys truly feel independent? Personally, I'm still struggling to break free from the shackles of laziness, kwkw. My life is still often controlled by this laziness, making it difficult to do various positive things, haha.

Therefore, I must continue to fight against it and finally become free from this laziness.

I hope that my friends who are still struggling can also achieve their independence today. I also hope that Indonesia becomes better and that the Golden Indonesia 2045 vision can truly be achieved, yeay! ╰(*°▽°*)╯
