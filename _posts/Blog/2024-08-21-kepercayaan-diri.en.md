Have you ever felt a loss of self-confidence? Like feeling weak, useless, and unworthy of anything? And then you keep thinking about it until you're too lazy to even start something? Because you feel like it's all going to end up the same way anyway, it won't mean anything.

That's exactly what I've been through. I thought, 'What's the point of trying if I'm just going to fail in the end?'

My self-confidence vanished because of a series of unfortunate events. I started questioning my own abilities.

As days went by, I felt weaker and weaker, my body felt heavy, my gaze was empty, and my mind was filled with overthinking.

It's like I didn't want to live, but I couldn't die either. I often fantasized about someone suddenly coming to my rescue.

I stayed in that state for a long time. Until finally, I realized that nothing was changing. In fact, my motivation to live was fading away.

Since I still had internet access, I tried to find ways to overcome this lack of self-confidence. From what I read on several websites, they said that self-confidence can be gained from small victories. So, we can start with simple things like waking up early and then move on to bigger things. That's what they said, and I'm trying this method now. Who knows, maybe it will work, haha.

I guess that's all for my rambling today. Hahaha
