### 30 July 2024

Today is only about starting some ideas like brainstorming the features, etc., for the Hidupi app. This app is a productivity app that uses a gamification concept. Here are the goals:

1. Increase productivity by providing a fun and engaging way to track and complete tasks.
2. Make work more fun and engaging by gamifying the process of task completion.
3. Motivate users to achieve their goals by providing rewards and recognition for their accomplishments.
4. Effortlessly export data to CSV.

Set up the Laravel project locally using the Laragon app.

For the template, I'm using [quixlab](https://github.com/themefisher/quixlab-bootstrap) at the moment, and I will edit and use it based on the features that I want to implement.
