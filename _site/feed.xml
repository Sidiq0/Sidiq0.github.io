(❁´◡`❁)</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Speaking of 17th of August celebrations, it’s usually synonymous with cracker eating contests, putting pencils into bottles contests, and so on. When I was little, I always looked forward to this day because I could participate in various competitions, haha.</p>

<p>Then, during junior high school, I liked Independence Day because there were often special events in online games. Back then, I used to play Point Blank.</p>

<p>Now, my reason for waiting for Independence Day has changed. Now, I want to enjoy the holiday and look for special Independence Day promos, hehe.</p>

<p>Btw, do you guys truly feel independent? Personally, I’m still struggling to break free from the shackles of laziness, kwkw. My life is still often controlled by this laziness, making it difficult to do various positive things, haha.</p>

<p>Therefore, I must continue to fight against it and finally become free from this laziness.</p>

<p>I hope that my friends who are still struggling can also achieve their independence today. I also hope that Indonesia becomes better and that the Golden Indonesia 2045 vision can truly be achieved, yeay! ╰(<em>°▽°</em>)╯</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, thank God, we have arrived at Indonesia’s 79th Independence Day!

(●’◡’●)</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So, Kanban is a tool used for project management in a visual way to simplify, increase efficiency, and manage workflows.</p>

<p>For example, like this, guys.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Abstract_Kanban_Board.svg/1920px-Abstract_Kanban_Board.svg.png" alt="kanban" /></p>
<center><h5>Sumber : Wikipedia</h5></center>

<p>In my opinion, Kanban is also suitable for us to use as a tool to monitor personal projects, such as creating portfolios and so on, as well as for other things like our daily to-do lists.</p>

<p>I use it here to manage my portfolio, daily to-do list, and also for my YouTube content planning, hehe.</p>

<p>The application I use is Trello, and for free members, you can get up to 10 boards for free, not bad, right? Personally, I also combine it with Habitica because I like its “gamify” concept.</p>

<p>By the way, for now, my main focus is to get used to writing first, so I’m still focusing on quantity over quality, hehe. So, yeah, the writing that is shared is still at a trivial stage, hehe.</p>

<p>That’s all from me, see you later! 👏</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kanban… are you guys familiar with it?

It’s time to make plans for tomorrow hehehe 😁.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My current goal is to get into the habit of making plans that actually get done, guys! So, it’s not just about making plans without taking any action, aka just talking . 🤣.</p>

<p>So, what should we do? Let’s start with the simplest way. That is, let’s start with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Adjusting Our Sleep Schedule<br />
 Start setting an alarm. You can start by going to bed and waking up 30 minutes earlier than your usual time, so you don’t get too shocked. After that, gradually adjust it until you find your ideal sleep schedule. The important thing is to just start adjusting. 👍.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determining 3 Main Tasks<br />
 For this one, we can just write down the most important things we want to do that day, maybe 3 at most. We can also use the SMART technique for writing tasks. So, we can know when we’re done and what it should look like. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. For example, “Write a short post of 250 words about planning techniques before 3 PM.” So, it’s clear, right? 😉.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think that’s enough for now hehe  😅.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening everyone!

Hopefully I can be consistent in the future.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The topic I want to discuss this time is about how we start something. Do we have to start with something “grand” or “amazing” first, or can we start with something small? So, the important thing is to just start, right?</p>

<p>I feel like I’m the type of person who is a perfectionist, who won’t start if the preparation isn’t perfect. So, it’s better not to start than to start but not be ready. So, the point is, I’m afraid before I start.</p>

<p>My focus is on planning as well and as detailed as possible, and only then take action after it’s okay. Planning here for me is a way to overcome the fear of something uncertain.</p>

<p>After thinking about it, I’m afraid of being criticized and judged. If the results are bad, I’m afraid of being ridiculed and considered a useless person.</p>

<p>But the funny thing is, I’ve been judged and belittled after doing my best and even in my opinion it was my best version. If doing your best with a great plan produces the best results, this incident wouldn’t be possible, right?</p>

<p>So I think, the effort used to do my best is not small and is greater than starting from something small first, and I feel it’s not fair if I’ve done my best but I’m still belittled like that.</p>

<p>As a result, I’m trying to conclude that doing your best with high effort before starting something may not necessarily produce better results than starting from something small first.</p>

<p>So, at least if you start small, the expectations are not too high and you will be more open to receiving criticism and improving yourself from there.</p>

<p>So, I’m trying to learn by just starting, and trying to think that getting things done is better than doing them perfectly.</p>

<p>That’s all for my writing today. Hehe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><category term="Life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alhamdulillah, I’m currently trying to write regularly, Insya Allah, one post a day.

Why “again”? Because I used to write regularly, but due to something A.K.A <del>laziness</del>, it became inconsistent, with ups and downs.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But hey guys, writing has many benefits, you know! For me personally, when writing, I am trained to learn how to organize the ideas in my head, so they don’t jump around.</p>

<p>So, when I was browsing the internet, it turns out there are many benefits, you know. It can start from clearing your head, reducing stress, or as a documentation of life’s journey. There are even those who make it a source of livelihood.</p>

<p>For me personally, the challenge in writing is laziness haha. Besides that, there is writer’s block, where I am confused about what to write. My head is completely blank.</p>

<p>So, what I’m trying to do is just start. Don’t think too much about the main idea, the important thing is to sit down and write whatever comes to mind, even if it doesn’t connect, it’s okay. Just write it first, then edit it later, hahaha.</p>

<p>On the internet, as far as I know, there are some suggestions for dealing with this mental block or, in the context of writing, writer’s block, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try simple physical activities, such as walking outside or washing dishes, and so on.</li>
  <li>Brainstorm, then create an outline. You can use a mind map.</li>
  <li>Set a deadline, so we set a deadline for when the writing should be done, utilizing the power of being under       pressure, hahaha.</li>

<!--more--></p>

<p>So far, I’ve used various apps, from Google Sheets to Habitica. These apps are good, but I feel like something’s missing, especially the game feel. 🤔</p>

<p>As a gamer, I can spend hours grinding in games. 🕹️ I’ve even fought bosses hundreds of times just to get cosmetic items that don’t affect the character’s strength. 😅 From there, I thought, what if this concept was applied to real life? For example, grinding to improve programming skills. 👨‍💻</p>

<p>Therefore, I want to make life more like a game, one of them is through a gamified productivity app. I’ve tried Habitica, but it’s still not to my liking and a bit complicated when exported to CSV format. 😕 I’m also not too keen on Notion. 🤷</p>

<p>Therefore, I want to create my own gamified productivity app using Laravel. 💪 Plus, this app can also be my portfolio. 😊</p>

<p>The name of this app is Hidupi, and you can check it out here… 👀</p>

Alhamdulillah, I’ve finally finished my first project: an e-voting system using Laravel.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Why Laravel? And why e-voting? Well, it’s actually quite simple. Seeing my sister working on a similar project, I got curious and wanted to try it myself. This is my very first project like this. As for web programming, I’m a total beginner, just knowing the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I only learned about Laravel after seeing my sister’s project.</p>

<p>This project was simple, but it still gave me a headache, haha. But you know, learning by directly working on a project is so much more fun and engaging compared to following courses or tutorials online. Sure, it was confusing at times, but it made me think about the purpose of learning to code. Sometimes, when we focus too much on tutorials, we end up confused about how to apply what we’ve learned in a real-world scenario.</p>

<p>For those who are curious, you can check out my project here…</p>

Well, that’s because I’ve been busy participating in the <a href="https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/arcade-fasilitator-id">Google Arcade Fasilitator 24 </a></p>

<!--more-->

<p>This program is a coding scholarship from Google with a gamification concept, like playing a game. We earn points for each course we complete, and those points can be exchanged for Google merchandise. The program ran from May 15, 2024, to July 15, 2024, and I didn’t join until June 15, 2024, so I was a bit short on time hehe 😅 .</p>

<p>Here is the Arcade point calculation scheme:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\points_system_bahasa_v2.png" alt="arcade_point" width="500" /></p>

<p>And here is the list of prizes:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\arcade_milestone.jpg" alt="arcade_prize" /></p>

<p>Since I was aiming for the premium prize, I had to collect at least 60 points. This means I needed to complete over 80 courses. Automatically, I had to think creatively to complete the courses quickly in a limited time ⏱️.</p>

<p>From there, I researched and found out about Shell Scripting. With Shell Scripting, I could combine the commands needed to complete the courses all at once, without having to manually copy and paste them into Google Cloud Shell ⌨️. Alhamdulillah, I managed to complete the courses in a total of 240 hours (from an estimated 389 hours), making it 30% faster ⚡️!</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\email.jpg" alt="arcade_prize" /></p>

<p>On July 22, 2024, I received a “love letter” from Google, yeay! All that’s left is to wait for the long-awaited merchandise to arrive at home 🥰.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Google Arcade" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 👋, it seems like it’s been over a month since I’ve updated this blog, hehe 😅 .

<!--more--></p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Hello, World!</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I bet the words “Hello World” sound super familiar, right? When we first started learning to code, it was like the official welcome wagon and the first thing most tutorials threw at us. 😆</p>

<p>Honestly, I kind of dig the whole “Hello World” thing. It’s like a warm hug that makes me want to dive deeper into the coding world. ✨  Speaking of diving in, this is my very first blog post, and I thought “Hello World” was a pretty fitting title, don’t you think? 😄</p>

<p>Since this is my first post, I wanted to chat a bit about taking that first step. It’s tough, I know. 😣 Especially for someone like me who tends to be a bit of a perfectionist. 😅I always feel like I need to research everything to death before I can actually do anything.</p>

<p>But when you take that too far, it’s easy to get stuck in planning mode and never actually take action. It’s like this weird illusion of being productive, but in reality, you’re just wasting time. 😫</p>

<p>So, why is it so hard to take that first step? For me, it’s the fear of failure and making mistakes. It feels like one wrong move and everything I’ve worked for will go up in smoke. 💥</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: what’s so bad about making mistakes? 🤔 What really happens when we mess up? Do we suddenly disappear? 👻 Nope! Most of the time, nobody even notices or cares. And even if it’s a mistake that affects others, usually the worst that happens is you get a little scolding. 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>So, what I’m trying to say is, planning is great, but too much planning can hold you back. Sometimes it’s better to just learn by doing, make mistakes, and then use that feedback to get better. 💪</p>

<p>Okay, I think that’s enough rambling for now. Just remember: “Just Do It” and good luck, friends! 🚀</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><category term="First Post" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 👋]]></summary></entry></feed>
