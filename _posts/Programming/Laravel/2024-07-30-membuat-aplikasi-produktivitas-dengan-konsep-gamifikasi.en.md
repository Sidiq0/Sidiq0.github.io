Good morning, guys! ☀️ This fine morning, I'm inspired to create a productivity app with a gamification concept. 🎮
<!--more-->

So far, I've used various apps, from Google Sheets to Habitica. These apps are good, but I feel like something's missing, especially the game feel. 🤔

As a gamer, I can spend hours grinding in games. 🕹️ I've even fought bosses hundreds of times just to get cosmetic items that don't affect the character's strength. 😅 From there, I thought, what if this concept was applied to real life? For example, grinding to improve programming skills. 👨‍💻

Therefore, I want to make life more like a game, one of them is through a gamified productivity app. I've tried Habitica, but it's still not to my liking and a bit complicated when exported to CSV format. 😕 I'm also not too keen on Notion. 🤷

Therefore, I want to create my own gamified productivity app using Laravel. 💪 Plus, this app can also be my portfolio. 😊

The name of this app is Hidupi, and you can check it out here... 👀
