Good evening everyone! It's time to make plans for tomorrow hehehe 😁.

My current goal is to get into the habit of making plans that actually get done, guys! So, it's not just about making plans without taking any action, aka just talking . 🤣.

So, what should we do? Let's start with the simplest way. That is, let's start with:

1. Adjusting Our Sleep Schedule\
    Start setting an alarm. You can start by going to bed and waking up 30 minutes earlier than your usual time, so you don't get too shocked. After that, gradually adjust it until you find your ideal sleep schedule. The important thing is to just start adjusting. 👍.

2. Determining 3 Main Tasks\
    For this one, we can just write down the most important things we want to do that day, maybe 3 at most. We can also use the SMART technique for writing tasks. So, we can know when we're done and what it should look like. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. For example, "Write a short post of 250 words about planning techniques before 3 PM." So, it's clear, right? 😉.

I think that's enough for now hehe  😅.
