Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹, good morning! Alhamdulillah, I've finally finished my first project: an e-voting system using Laravel.
<!--more-->

Why Laravel? And why e-voting? Well, it's actually quite simple. Seeing my sister working on a similar project, I got curious and wanted to try it myself. This is my very first project like this. As for web programming, I'm a total beginner, just knowing the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I only learned about Laravel after seeing my sister's project.


This project was simple, but it still gave me a headache, haha. But you know, learning by directly working on a project is so much more fun and engaging compared to following courses or tutorials online. Sure, it was confusing at times, but it made me think about the purpose of learning to code. Sometimes, when we focus too much on tutorials, we end up confused about how to apply what we've learned in a real-world scenario.

For those who are curious, you can check out my project here...
