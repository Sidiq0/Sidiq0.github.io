Well, that’s because I’ve been busy participating in the <a href="https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/arcade-fasilitator-id">Google Arcade Fasilitator 24 </a></p>

<p>This program is a coding scholarship from Google with a gamification concept, like playing a game. We earn points for each course we complete, and those points can be exchanged for Google merchandise. The program ran from May 15, 2024, to July 15, 2024, and I didn’t join until June 15, 2024, so I was a bit short on time hehe 😅 .</p>

<p>Here is the Arcade point calculation scheme:</p>

<p>And here is the list of prizes:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\arcade_milestone.jpg" alt="arcade_prize" /></p>

<p>Since I was aiming for the premium prize, I had to collect at least 60 points. This means I needed to complete over 80 courses. Automatically, I had to think creatively to complete the courses quickly in a limited time ⏱️.</p>

<p>From there, I researched and found out about Shell Scripting. With Shell Scripting, I could combine the commands needed to complete the courses all at once, without having to manually copy and paste them into Google Cloud Shell ⌨️. Alhamdulillah, I managed to complete the courses in a total of 240 hours (from an estimated 389 hours), making it 30% faster ⚡️!</p>

<p>On July 22, 2024, I received a “love letter” from Google, yeay! All that’s left is to wait for the long-awaited merchandise to arrive at home 🥰.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 👋, it seems like it’s been over a month since I’ve updated this blog, hehe 😅 .

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Hello, World!</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I bet the words “Hello World” sound super familiar, right? When we first started learning to code, it was like the official welcome wagon and the first thing most tutorials threw at us. 😆</p>

<p>Honestly, I kind of dig the whole “Hello World” thing. It’s like a warm hug that makes me want to dive deeper into the coding world. ✨  Speaking of diving in, this is my very first blog post, and I thought “Hello World” was a pretty fitting title, don’t you think? 😄</p>

<p>Since this is my first post, I wanted to chat a bit about taking that first step. It’s tough, I know. 😣 Especially for someone like me who tends to be a bit of a perfectionist. 😅I always feel like I need to research everything to death before I can actually do anything.</p>

<p>But when you take that too far, it’s easy to get stuck in planning mode and never actually take action. It’s like this weird illusion of being productive, but in reality, you’re just wasting time. 😫</p>

<p>So, why is it so hard to take that first step? For me, it’s the fear of failure and making mistakes. It feels like one wrong move and everything I’ve worked for will go up in smoke. 💥</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: what’s so bad about making mistakes? 🤔 What really happens when we mess up? Do we suddenly disappear? 👻 Nope! Most of the time, nobody even notices or cares. And even if it’s a mistake that affects others, usually the worst that happens is you get a little scolding. 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>So, what I’m trying to say is, planning is great, but too much planning can hold you back. Sometimes it’s better to just learn by doing, make mistakes, and then use that feedback to get better. 💪</p>

<p>Okay, I think that’s enough rambling for now. Just remember: “Just Do It” and good luck, friends! 🚀</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidiq</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Personal" /><category term="First Post" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 👋]]></summary></entry></feed>
