Hidupi is a productivity app that makes getting things done fun and rewarding. We combine task management with gamification elements like challenges, rewards, and progress tracking to help you stay motivated and achieve your goals.

<h3>30 July 2024</h3>

<p>Today is only about starting some ideas like brainstorming the features, etc., for the Hidupi app. This app is a productivity app that uses a gamification concept. Here are the goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Increase productivity by providing a fun and engaging way to track and complete tasks.</li>
  <li>Make work more fun and engaging by gamifying the process of task completion.</li>
  <li>Motivate users to achieve their goals by providing rewards and recognition for their accomplishments.</li>
  <li>Effortlessly export data to CSV.</li>
</ol>

<p>Set up the Laravel project locally using the Laragon app.</p>

<p>For the template, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/themefisher/quixlab-bootstrap">quixlab</a> at the moment, and I will edit and use it based on the features that I want to implement.</p>

<h3>31 July 2024</h3>

<p>Today, I focused on building the landing pages for our project. I chose to use the <a href="https://themewagon.github.io/knight/">Knight</a> template as a starting point due to its clean design and easy customization.</p>

<p>Progress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Navbar: Added "Login" and "Join" buttons for user convenience.</li>
  <li>Logo: Replaced the default logo with our project's logo.</li>
  <li>Content: Added sections for "About Us" and "Mission" to introduce our project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the landing pages are starting to take shape. I'll continue refining the design and adding more content in the next few days.</p>

<h3>01 August 2024</h3>

<p>Today, I focused on building the login and registration pages using Laravel Breeze. I started by customizing the look and feel, making small changes like adjusting button colors and adding our project logo.</p>

<p>Testing:</p>

<p>I thoroughly tested the "Forgot Password" and "Reset Password" features to ensure they work seamlessly. I used Mailtrap to simulate email sending and verify that users receive password reset links correctly.</p>
