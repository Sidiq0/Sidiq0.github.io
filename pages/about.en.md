Hi there! I'm Sidiq, and I'm just starting out on my programming journey. I've always been fascinated by how things work, and now I'm learning how to build them myself.

Before diving into code, I spent a lot of time with Google Sheets, organizing data and automating tasks. It was my first taste of the power of technology. Now, I'm excited to explore the world of programming and see where it takes me.

In my free time, I love to write about interesting things I find online.I'll be sharing my thoughts and discoveries here, so feel free to join me on this adventure
