Kanban... are you guys familiar with it? (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)

<!--more-->

So, Kanban is a tool used for project management in a visual way to simplify, increase efficiency, and manage workflows.

For example, like this, guys.

 In my opinion, Kanban is also suitable for us to use as a tool to monitor personal projects, such as creating portfolios and so on, as well as for other things like our daily to-do lists.

I use it here to manage my portfolio, daily to-do list, and also for my YouTube content planning, hehe.

The application I use is Trello, and for free members, you can get up to 10 boards for free, not bad, right? Personally, I also combine it with Habitica because I like its "gamify" concept.

By the way, for now, my main focus is to get used to writing first, so I'm still focusing on quantity over quality, hehe. So, yeah, the writing that is shared is still at a trivial stage, hehe.

That's all from me, see you later! üëè
