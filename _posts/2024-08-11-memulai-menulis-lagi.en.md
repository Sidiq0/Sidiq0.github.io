Okay, it's time to start writing again. Why "again"? Because I used to write regularly, but due to something A.K.A ~~laziness~~, it became inconsistent, with ups and downs.

But hey guys, writing has many benefits, you know! For me personally, when writing, I am trained to learn how to organize the ideas in my head, so they don't jump around.

So, when I was browsing the internet, it turns out there are many benefits, you know. It can start from clearing your head, reducing stress, or as a documentation of life's journey. There are even those who make it a source of livelihood.

For me personally, the challenge in writing is laziness haha. Besides that, there is writer's block, where I am confused about what to write. My head is completely blank.

So, what I'm trying to do is just start. Don't think too much about the main idea, the important thing is to sit down and write whatever comes to mind, even if it doesn't connect, it's okay. Just write it first, then edit it later, hahaha.

On the internet, as far as I know, there are some suggestions for dealing with this mental block or, in the context of writing, writer's block, including:

1. Try simple physical activities, such as walking outside or washing dishes, and so on.
2. Brainstorm, then create an outline. You can use a mind map.
3. Set a deadline, so we set a deadline for when the writing should be done, utilizing the power of being under       pressure, hahaha.
